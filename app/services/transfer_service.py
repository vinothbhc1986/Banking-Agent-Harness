"""In-memory pending-transfer state.

A single pending slot is enough for this single-session demo — no database
or workflow engine needed. Requiring `confirm_transfer` to execute against
this real state (instead of exposing a tool parameter like
`skip_confirmation`) is what makes confirmation deterministic: the model can
be asked to skip it, but there is no code path that lets it.
